# Unwind

### What is unwind?üßê 
Unwind is an iOS shortcut which I developed to unravel deep webs of tweets. It was something which I developed because I wanted an easy way to share interesting conversations with people who were not on twitter.

I wrote the backend using node.js and express with little prioer expedrience

### How does it work?ü§®
Unwind works by starting from whichever tweet you shared to the shortcut and for any given tweet, placing a tweet which it was replying to or quoting above it in a chain.

### Where can I find the shortcut?

It can be found from this [link](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/412b347203814f3ca2ded346799e9c12), but it will only work on an iOS device.
